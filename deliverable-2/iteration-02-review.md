# MaleCare/Team 11

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
 >      
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.

 * When: FILL IN THE DATE WHEN YOU ACTUALLY HAD YOUR REVIEW MEETING

## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

1. from node js to flask
2. devide feature to D2 and D3, 
    D2: register/login, profile, match, chat(only text), admin notification, main page, request page
    D3: block, report, send picture, AWS S3, geo
3. task board https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IbYSnSneb-Hv0m9sljIn_qT3puhcViF-GEtengPN3bk/edit#gid=0
 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

1. We underestimated the time needed to finish D2 and started late. In the end, everyone was exhausted in order to implement the functionalities. 
2. Decide to start without designing input/output of  API before start, in order to save time

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be unsuccessful
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).


#### Q3. Planned changes

List any **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

1. share deadline of outher work, organize well
2. agree on API before developing new feature
3. more meeting, more comunication, weekly meeting not enough
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.


## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
## TODO: after feedback
 * How did you prepare your demo?
 * What did you manage to demo to your partner?
 * Did your partner accept the features?
 * Were there change requests?
 * What did you learn from the demo from either a process or product perspective?
 * *This section will be marked very leniently so keep it brief and just make sure the points are addressed*
