# MaleCare/Team 11

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
 >      
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

 * When: FILL IN THE DATE WHEN YOU ACTUALLY HAD YOUR REVIEW MEETING
 * Where: Online

## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

1. Rather than follow the plan of deliverable 1 strictly, our team decided to be more viable. It does bring some chaos to our team organization and planning, but it also lets us develop more quickly. The trade-off is happening here. Developing quickly meaning that we can see our progress in a short amount of time, which can be inspiring to us. An example of being viable is that we discard the plan of using node and use flask for back-end instead. 
2. We decide to divide features into things to be done in D2 and D3 before we started. 
    D2: register/login, profile, match, chat(only text), admin notification, main page, request page
    D3: block, report, rich text editor for chat, geolocation, storing pictures on AWS S3
3. We are having a task board to assign work to each other. This enables us to have less conflicts when working on one codebase. Also, the goals are trackable and everyone can see the concrete progress of our team. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IbYSnSneb-Hv0m9sljIn_qT3puhcViF-GEtengPN3bk/edit#gid=0
 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).


#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

1. We underestimated the time needed to finish D2 and started late. In the end, everyone was exhausted in order to implement the functionalities before the deadline. 

2. In order to save time, the team has decided to not spending time designing the parameters of APIs and start directly. Because the frontend and backend were implemented asynchronously, sometimes we had to change the API that has been written to meet the needs of the frontend, which wasted a lot of time, and also produced some hard-to-find bugs.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be unsuccessful
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).


#### Q3. Planned changes

List any **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

1. share deadline of outher work, organize well
2. agree on API before developing new feature
3. more meeting, more comunication, weekly meeting not enough
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.


## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
## TODO: after feedback
 * How did you prepare your demo?
 * What did you manage to demo to your partner?
 * Did your partner accept the features?
 * Were there change requests?
 * What did you learn from the demo from either a process or product perspective?
 * *This section will be marked very leniently so keep it brief and just make sure the points are addressed*
