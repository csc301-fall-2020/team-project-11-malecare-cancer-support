# MaleCare/Team 11

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
 >      
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

 * When: FILL IN THE DATE WHEN YOU ACTUALLY HAD YOUR REVIEW MEETING
 * Where: Online

## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

1. from node js to flask
2. devide feature to D2 and D3, 
    D2: register/login, profile, match, chat(only text), admin notification, main page, request page
    D3: block, report, send picture, AWS S3, geo
3. task board https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IbYSnSneb-Hv0m9sljIn_qT3puhcViF-GEtengPN3bk/edit#gid=0
 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

1. We underestimated the time needed to finish D2 and started late. In the end, everyone was exhausted in order to implement the functionalities before the deadline. 

2. In order to save time, the team has decided to not spending time designing the parameters of APIs and start directly. Because the frontend and backend were implemented asynchronously, sometimes we had to change the API that has been written to meet the needs of the frontend, which wasted a lot of time, and also produced some hard-to-find bugs.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be unsuccessful
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).


#### Q3. Planned changes

List any **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

1. Share deadlines, organize better:  
Though in the past few months, we are doing fine organizing and splitting the work, we have an opinion that we can organize our group work better if we share our deadlines and our time schedule ahead. Since our group members are in different time zones and we have different course works, 
we are planning to consider every member's schedule and project deadlines to have better plans for our project work. Divide the work into several small milestones might also be beneficial for us. We will plan to do this, too.
2. Agree on API before developing new features:  
At deliverable-2, we start our coding work before we designing complete APIs. This means overtimes, members who work at the front-end will need to communicate with back-end members on deciding APIs. This is more time consuming than we thought due to the timezone issue. It will be efficient if we can agree on complete APIs before doing our work.
3. More meetings, more communication:  
At deliverable-2, we have weekly meetings with MaleCare and have a lot of group meetings. But we still think this is not enough. We need to have more communication with group members as well as MaleCare. We can easily be aware of our group members' work process and if some of the group members need help, we can help them.

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.


## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
## TODO: after feedback
 * How did you prepare your demo?
 * What did you manage to demo to your partner?
 * Did your partner accept the features?
 * Were there change requests?
 * What did you learn from the demo from either a process or product perspective?
 * *This section will be marked very leniently so keep it brief and just make sure the points are addressed*
