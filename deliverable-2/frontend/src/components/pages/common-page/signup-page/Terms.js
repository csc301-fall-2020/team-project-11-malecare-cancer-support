      </p>

      <p>
        9. Binding Arbitration of All Disputes; No Class Relief. o S. Residents:
        To the fullest extend permissible by law, with the exception of disputes
        pertaining to Malecare’s intellectual property rights and certain
        statutory claims that, pursuant to law, are not arbitrable, any dispute
        of any kind between you and Malecare arising under these Terms shall be
        resolved through binding arbitration pursuant to the JAMS Streamlined
        Arbitration Rules and Procedures on an individual basis with no class
        relief. The arbitrator shall be a retired judge or justice of any
        California state or federal court with substantial experience in the
        internet industry and shall follow California substantive law in
        adjudicating the dispute, except that this Section 9(a) shall be
        construed as a “written agreement to arbitrate” pursuant to the Federal
        Arbitration Act (“FAA”). You and we agree that we intend that this
        Section 9(a) satisfies the “writing” requirement of the FAA. The hearing
        shall be conducted in the county that encompasses the billing address
        you have provided to Malecare. For any claim in which you seek U.S.
        $10,000.00 or less, you shall have the choice as to whether the hearing
        is conducted in person, by telephone, or instead the arbitrator may
        decide the dispute without a hearing. For those claims that the
        arbitrator determines are not frivolous, Malecare shall pay the costs
        and fees of JAMS and the arbitrator. Malecare agrees that it will not
        seek reimbursement from you for its costs and fees incurred by it in the
        arbitration. AGREEMENT TO THESE TERMS CONSTITUTES AN AGREEMENT TO PURSUE
        YOUR CLAIM ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND A WAIVER OF THE ABILITY TO PURSUE
        YOUR CLAIM IN A CLASS ACTION. o Non-U.S. Residents: If any controversy,
        allegation, or claim (including any non-contractual claim) arises out of
        or relates to the Site or Terms of Service, then you and we agree to
        send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of
        the Section 9(b) Dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it. Our
        notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact
        information that you provide us. But if no such information exists or if
        such information is not current, then we have no obligation under this
        Section 9(b). Your notice to us must be sent to us at info@malecare.com.
        For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from
        the other party, Malecare and you will engage in a dialogue in order to
        attempt to resolve the Section 9(b) Dispute, though nothing will require
        either you or Malecare to resolve the Section 9(b) Dispute on terms
        either you or Malecare, in each of our sole discretion, are
        uncomfortable. Nothing in this Section will prevent a party from
        pursuing their claims in Court or another complaint process.{" "}
