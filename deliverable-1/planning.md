# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME
> _Note:_ This document is meant to evolve throughout the planning phase of your project.   That is, it makes sense for you commit regularly to this file while working on the project (especially edits/additions/deletions to the _Highlights_ section). Most importantly, it is a reflection of all the planning you work you've done in the first iteration. 
 > **This document will serve as a master plan between your team, your partner and your TA.**

## Product Details
 
#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

 > Short (1 - 2 min' read)
 * Start with a single sentence, high-level description of the product.
 * Be clear - Describe the problem you are solving in simple terms.
 * Be concrete. For example:
    * What are you planning to build? Is it a website, mobile app,
   browser extension, command-line app, etc.?      
    * When describing the problem/need, give concrete examples of common use cases.
    * Assume your the reader knows nothing about the problem domain and provide the necessary context. 
 * Focus on *what* your product does, and avoid discussing *how* you're going to implement it.      
   For example: This is not the time or the place to talk about which programming language and/or framework you are planning to use.
 * **Feel free (and very much encouraged) to include useful diagrams, mock-ups and/or links**.
 
We are planning to build a website, providing matches to cancer patients to hook-up, look for a mentor, or become other patients' mentors.

#### Q: How to provide matches for users?
	First, Our product will provide several tags (e.g. Need-Mentor, Want-Hookup, etc) to let users choose from, users can define  
	their purpose by choosing the correct tags for themselves.  
	Then the product can provide matches for users. (see below)

#### Q: How to match up users?
	Our product will have a setting(tags, ages, gender, location, etc) on the main page.  
	It makes sure that the matches we provide meet the user's will. 

#### Q:  How to show matches?
	On the main page, our product will display a person's photos and profiles once a time. 

#### Q:  What operations can users do for matches?
	Users can make these decisions: 
 	- Chat with him
 	- Show more about him
 	- Swap to next person
 
(The mock-ups needed)

#### Q2: Who are your target users?
	The target users are cancer patients who have (one or multiple) below needs: 
	- Want to hook-up 
	- Want to have a mentor 
	- Want to be a mentor

  > Short (1 - 2 min' read max)
 * Be specific (e.g. a 'a third-year university student studying Computer Science' and not 'a student')
 * **Feel free (but not obligated) to use personas.         
   You can create your personas as part of this Markdown file, or add a link to an external site (for example, [Xtensio](https://xtensio.com/user-persona/)).**
   



#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?
	The product provides several matches as user required.
	Users will see the tags for this match in the profile section, to verify the requirement. 
	Moreover, the product provides a chatroom for users who have an agreement on matches to chat.

	Since there are no similar apps available now, we are providing a new platform for them to use. 
	The product also requires the user to define themselves' need and use filter to search,   
	in this way we can provide users with matches that meet user's requirements.
	
	This product follows the instruction that the partner provided and the main functionality  
	are decided on the meeting with the partner.

 * We want you to "connect the dots" for us - Why does your product (as described in your answer to Q1) fits the needs of your users (as described in your answer to Q2)?
 * Explain the benefits of your product explicitly & clearly. For example:
    * Save users time (how much?)
    * Allow users to discover new information (which information? And, why couldn't they discover it before?)
    * Provide users with more accurate and/or informative data (what kind of data? Why is it useful to them?)
    * Does this application exist in another form? If so, how does your differ and provide value to the users?
    * How does this align with your partner's organization's values/mission/mandate?
    
No similar apps and they have needs
(what the app can do: find people also have cancer and can understand each other)

#### Q4: How will you build it?

> Short (1-2 min' read max)
 * What is the technology stack? Specify any and all languages, frameworks, libraries, PaaS products or tools. 
 * How will you deploy the application?
 * Describe the architecture - what are the high level components or patterns you will use? Diagrams are useful here. 
 * Will you be using third party applications or APIs? If so, what are they?
 * What is your testing strategy?
 
 frontend: react
 backend: node
 database: sql/mongodb
 api: geo, (maybe chatroom)
 

#### Q5: What are the user stories that make up the MVP?

 * At least 5 user stories concerning the main features of the application - note that this can broken down further
 * You must follow proper user story format (as taught in lecture) ```As a <user of the app>, I want to <do something in the app> in order to <accomplish some goal>```
 * If you have a partner, these must be reviewed and accepted by them
 * The user stories should be written in Github and each one must have clear acceptance criteria.
